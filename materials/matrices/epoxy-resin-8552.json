  "detailed_description": "Hexcel 8552 is a high-performance toughened epoxy matrix system specifically designed for aerospace prepreg applications. It represents a significant advancement in epoxy technology, offering exceptional damage tolerance while maintaining the high-temperature performance required for aircraft primary structures.\n\n**Toughening Technology**: The 8552 system incorporates advanced toughening agents that significantly improve resistance to impact damage and delamination. Interlaminar fracture toughness (GIc) is 2-3 times higher than earlier generation aerospace epoxies, resulting in better damage tolerance and longer service life.\n\n**Hot/Wet Performance**: Maintains excellent mechanical properties at elevated temperatures, even after moisture absorption. The glass transition temperature (Tg) of 190°C provides adequate margin for typical aircraft operating conditions. Retains over 70% of room temperature strength at 82°C wet conditions (FAA certification standard).\n\n**Processing Characteristics**: Designed for autoclave processing with standard aerospace cure cycles. Exhibits controlled viscosity during cure, enabling good fiber wet-out and minimal void content. The resin demonstrates excellent tack and drape for hand layup operations while maintaining sufficient shelf life for manufacturing flexibility.\n\n**Qualification Status**: Widely qualified by major aerospace OEMs including Boeing, Airbus, Lockheed Martin, and Northrop Grumman. Extensive material property databases available for design and certification. Used in numerous certified aircraft programs.\n\n**Applications**: Aircraft primary structures (wing skins, spars, fuselage panels), helicopter rotor blades, aerospace tooling, satellite structures, and other applications requiring high reliability and damage tolerance.\n\n**Handling Requirements**: Requires freezer storage at -18°C. Out-life at room temperature is 21 days. Cured parts typically require post-cure at 190°C for 2 hours to develop full properties.",
